# Responsive Photo Gallery

## Project Overview
The **Responsive Photo Gallery** is a front-end web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The project showcases a clean and interactive gallery where users can view images in a responsive grid layout. Clicking on any image opens a larger preview in a modal window. The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. This project demonstrates core front-end skills including DOM manipulation, event handling, responsive design, and UI/UX best practices.
